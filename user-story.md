someone comes to the site in search of help with their budgeting. they are unorganized and constantly falling behind as a result. it's nearly impossible for them to know how much money they have when the majority of the money they get is spent on bills that are known ahead of time.

so when they get to the site with this in mind,
we let them know that we can get them organized by creating a budget. 

Once the budget is made, a custom url is created to save the budget.

After getting organized and no longer receiving unexpected legitimate payments, they want more. They try the time based reminders. They are paying their bills earlier now. They try the time-locked accounts. Through the time-locked accounts, they secure over $1,000 dollars on a rolling basis to ensure their living expenses are always available for the upcoming month.

Now they are free to create a new budget expense for the things they enjoy doing, rather than paying back principal, interest and fees.

They start saving for a vacation. This time in a 4 month time-locked account.

Putting away only 50 dollars each week, they are able to save $800 for a vacation.

 Two months in they have to abort the account. Their car broke down and needed emergency repairs. While the car was in the shop getting repaired for a few days, he went and got his backup key stored in a safe in his fathers home. He takes the document storing the coins and retrieves them for cash. It's an emergency and the funds were set aside for entertainment purposes, so the current turn in rate wasn't even checked.
 
 It ended up that the rates were ok, no large variance occured and the entire account didn't need to be depleted so there was still a balance remaining in the vacation fund for the future.
 
 Using the backup key, the lock-date was set back two more months. The backup key was stored away in the safe and 
 
 Note: The backup key is actually a third-key. Two keys would be needed with something like a phone or common password being the second.
 
 Every time the primary key and the phone or the backup key and the phone or the phone and the backup key can unlock the account.
