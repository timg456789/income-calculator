# Fixes Required

## Transaction HTML
The name and amount of each transaction needs to be in the same div so there is no more of the awkward overlap. Then spans can be used.

## Totals
The totals need a name. I'm going to be putting the budgeted net in addition to the final net so it will get confusing.

## Legend
Desperately need a legend in order to describe the various transaction types that are described only by style.

## Offending budget item
Maybe maybe maybe add something to identify when an expenditure went over budget. It should be outlined like an unbudgeted expense. It could be a little softer like the soft red used for expenses. The items in yellow are meant to be excluded and an over budget contributes to the variance between budgeted and actual so these become important.

The latest version of chrome is be supported.

# Unsupported Browsers

## Safari on iPhone

The calendar isn't showing biweekly income.

Plans to support: I'd like to for mobile purposes, but it's a low priority until I have spending against budgets working correctly. After that I still need to build out the interface and back-end to do use the spending remotely. I have a fair amount of work to do before this would add value, but this is a core piece for the project.x

## IE Edge

The vertical scroll bar hide and show on this browser is driving me nuts. I don't think I will ever support this browser.
