## Safari on iPhone

The calendar isn't showing biweekly income.

Plans to support: I'd like to for mobile purposes, but it's a low priority until I have spending against budgets working correctly. After that I still need to build out the interface and back-end to do use the spending remotely. I have a fair amount of work to do before this would add value, but this is a core piece for the project.x

## IE Edge

The vertical scroll bar hide and show on this browser is driving me nuts. I don't think I will ever support this browser.
