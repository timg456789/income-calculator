## Credentials
An AWS public/private key can be used in the URL in order to create and return to new budgets. For example: ?pub=[ACCESS_KEY]&priv[SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]=&data=[OBJECT_NAME].json.

S3 read and write permissions are required for the bucket.

The bucket is hard-coded to `income-calculator`.

## Offending budget item
This would need to get added to the core processing.
